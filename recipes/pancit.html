    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancit is a traditional Filipino noodle dish that's both flavorful and satisfying. Made with stir-fried rice or egg noodles, it's cooked with a delicious mix of vegetables, meat, and savory seasonings. Popular variations include Pancit Canton (thick egg noodles), Pancit Bihon (thin rice noodles), and Pancit Malabon (thicker rice noodles with a rich seafood sauce). Often served during celebrations and gatherings, pancit symbolizes long life and good fortune. Enjoy it with a squeeze of calamansi or a side of crispy lumpia for the perfect Filipino feast!
